# Automating your iOS App Development Workflow: Continuous Deployment and Testing with GitHub Actions

Are you striving to iterate quickly to deliver new features, all while ensuring the reliability and performance of your iOS application? Efficient workflows are key to achiving this goal. In this article, we'll explore how we can leverage the power of Github Actions to automate continuous deployment and testing.

First, let's focus on how to automate test execution whenever a pull-request is created. Unit tests are crucial in software development as they identify errors early in the process and enable safe code refactoring without regression.

We start by defining a Worklfow, named "Deploy to App Store Connect" that is responsible to archive the app and upload the build artifact to App Store connect. Below

```yml
name: Deploy to App Store Connect

on:
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  archive-and-deploy:
    runs-on: macos-latest

    steps:
    	- name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

        ...
```
