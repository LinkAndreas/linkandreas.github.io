# Networking in large-scale iOS Applications

Networking serves as the backbone of mobile applications, facilitating seamless communication and enabling rich user experiences. However, it also introduces complexity, especially when dealing with modular applications that are built from independent features. 

Modularity offers many benefits, such as a faster development cycle and better scalability. But it also requires a robust approach to handle cross-cutting concerns among features. Since networking is a cross-cutting concern, it cannot be easily encapsulated in any of them. 

In this article, we explore a lightweight approach to deal with networking in modular iOS applications.

## Naive Approach

First, let's take a look at the naive approach where multiple independent features directly depend on the networking package.

![Naive Approach](article_18_02_2024_naive_approach.svg)

Even though the latter encapsulates the ability to communicate over the network, it adds up to the total build time of each feature, since compiling the feature requires compilation of the entire network package as well. Especially when working in feature teams it is desired to minimize the amount of direct dependencies such that we can benefit from shorter build times and a fast feedback loop. 

## Lightweight Approach in modular Applications

To ensure that we do not need to compile the network-related code when working on a feature, we introduce a lightweight abstraction called `HTTPClient` that is exposed to every feature but does not contain a concrete implementation.

```swift
/// Abstraction for executing HTTP network requests.
public protocol HTTPClient {
    /// Executes the given request and returns the received data and response including the StatusCode.
    /// - Parameter request: The request to be executed.
    /// - Returns: The received data and response (including the StatusCode).
    @discardableResult
    func load(request: HTTPRequest) async throws -> (Data, HTTPResponse)
}
```

The abstraction only consists of the `load(request:)` method that given an `HTTPRequest` returns the received data along with the `HTTPResponse`. The `HTTPRequest` contains all information necessary to perform the request, like the `method`, `path`, `headers` and `queryParameters`. In addition, the `body` parameter is used to specify the content that is transmitted with the request.

```swift
/// Abstraction describing an HTTP network request.
public protocol HTTPRequest {
    /// The HTTP method of the request.
    var method: HTTPMethod { get }
    /// The path of the request endpoint.
    var path: HTTPPath { get }
    /// The endpoint version of the request.
    var version: HTTPVersion { get }
    /// The headers to be transmitted with the request.
    var headers: HTTPHeaders? { get }
    /// The query parameters to be transmitted with the request.
    var queryParameter: HTTPQueryParameter? { get }
    /// The content to be transmitted with the request.
    var body: Data? { get }
}
```

Some parameters are declared *optional* since they may not be necessary for every request. Hence, developers have the flexibility to omit these parameters, streamlining the implementation and improving code readability.

```swift
extension HTTPRequest {
    public var headers: HTTPHeaders? { nil }
    public var queryParameter: HTTPQueryParameter? { nil }
    public var body: Data? { nil }
}
```

Let's briefly go through the meaning of each of the parameters.

First, the `HTTPMethod` enumeration corresponds to the methods permitted for HTTP requests. Alongside `GET` for data retrieval, it also includes `POST` for creating a resource, as well as `PUT` and `PATCH` for updating the resource, and `DELETE` for removing it when no longer needed.

```swift
/// The HTTP method of the network request.
public enum HTTPMethod: String, Equatable {
    case get = "GET"
    case post = "POST"
    case put = "PUT"
    case patch = "PATCH"
    case delete = "DELETE"
}

extension HTTPMethod {
    public var name: String {
        rawValue
    }
}
```

Next, the `HTTPPath` in conjunction with the `HTTPVersion` specify the endpoint targeted by the request. Both are defined as type aliases of `String` to better derive a semantic meaning when looking at the type itself.

```swift
/// The path of the network request.
public typealias HTTPPath = String
/// The version of the HTTP endpoint.
public typealias HTTPVersion = String
```

Next, `HTTPHeader` defines standard headers that are included in most requests. For instance, the `contentType` attribute specifies the type of content being transmitted in the request body.

```swift
/// Standard headers that can be transmitted in requests to the backend.
public enum HTTPHeader: String {
    /// The data format accepted by the client (e.g., `application/json`).
    case accept = "Accept"
    /// The type of content being sent in the body (e.g., `application/json`).
    case contentType = "Content-Type"
}
```

Finally, similar to `HTTPPath`, both `HTTPHeaders` and `HTTPQueryParameter` utilize type aliases to give meaning to the underlying `String` key-value pairs.

```swift
/// Dictionary of headers sent or received as key-value pairs in network requests.
public typealias HTTPHeaders = [String: String]
/// Key-value pairs transmitted as query parameters in network requests.
public typealias HTTPQueryParameter = [String: String]
```

Having referred to the properties of an `HTTPRequest`, let's now shift our focus to the `HTTPResponse` that is received upon successful execution of `load(request:)`.

```swift
/// Contains the response to a network request.
public struct HTTPResponse {
    /// The StatusCode of the response.
    public let statusCode: HTTPStatusCode
    /// The headers of the response.
    public let headers: HTTPHeaders?

    /// Initializes a `HTTPResponse` for a given StatusCode and Header.
    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - statusCode: The StatusCode of the response.
    ///   - headers: The headers of the response.
    public init(statusCode: HTTPStatusCode, headers: HTTPHeaders? = nil) {
        self.statusCode = statusCode
        self.headers = headers
    }
}

/// The StatusCode contained in a response to a network request.
public typealias HTTPStatusCode = Int
```

In contrast to the request, the `HTTPResponse` only comprises two properties: the `statusCode` and `headers`. While the status code communicates the outcome of the request, the `headers` are optional and enable the server to provide supplementary information to the client alongside the response.

Furthermore, extensions are implemented to streamline the determination of the response's nature, categorizing it into types such as `informational`, `successful`, `redirection`, `client error`, or `server error`. This eliminates the need to memorize status code ranges.

```swift
extension HTTPResponse {
    /// Status indicating whether it is an informational response.
    /// - seealso: For more information, see [mdm web docs - Information responses](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status#information_responses)
    public var isInformational: Bool {
        (100 ..< 200).contains(statusCode)
    }

    /// Status indicating whether it is a successful response.
    /// - seealso: For more information, see [mdm web docs - Successful responses](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status#successful_responses)
    public var isSuccess: Bool {
        (200 ..< 300).contains(statusCode)
    }

    /// Status indicating whether it is a redirection response.
    /// - seealso: For more information, see [mdm web docs - Redirection messages](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status#redirection_messages)
    public var isRedirectional: Bool {
        (300 ..< 400).contains(statusCode)
    }

    /// Status indicating whether it is a client error response.
    /// - seealso: For more information, see [mdm web docs - Client error responses](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status#client_error_responses)
    public var isClientError: Bool {
        (400 ..< 500).contains(statusCode)
    }

    /// Status indicating whether it is a server error response.
    /// - seealso: For more information, see [mdm web docs - Server error responses](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status#server_error_responses)
    public var isServerError: Bool {
        (500 ..< 600).contains(statusCode)
    }

    /// Status indicating whether it is an error response.
    public var isError: Bool {
        (400 ..< 600).contains(statusCode)
    }
}
```

As a result, relying solely on the `HTTPClient` abstraction has a negligible impact on the feature's build time. Moreover, the feature avoids dealing with 3rd party dependencies like `Moya`, `Alamofire` or Apple's `URLSession`. Instead, it only uses the abstraction to communicate over the network and assumes that a concrete implementation will be provided by another entity. This assumption is key to decouple features from cross-cutting concerns and develop them in isolation.

![Architecture](article_18_02_2024_feature_abstraction.svg)

## Infrastructure: "URLSessionInfrastructure"

Still, when integrating the feature, we need to ensure that its' requirements are fulfilled by a concrete implementation. The latter is provided by infrastructure modules that may use a 3rd party library to achieve the intended result. For instance, the `URLSessionInfrastructure` package may use Apple's `URLSession` to execute the request.

![Architecture](article_18_02_2024_feature_abstraction_infrastructure.svg)

In this manner, only the infrastructure package directly relies on third-party frameworks, staying agnostic from infrastructure details. Below you can find an example implementation of the `URLSessionClient`:

```swift
import Foundation

public final class URLSessionClient: HTTPClient {
    enum Error: Swift.Error {
        case noHttpURLResponse
        case invalidHeaderArguments
    }

    private let baseURL: URL
    private let session: URLSession

    public init(baseURL: URL, session: URLSession = .shared) {
        self.baseURL = baseURL
        self.session = session
    }

    public func load(request: HTTPRequest) async throws -> (Data, HTTPResponse) {
        let url = baseURL
            .appending(path: request.version)
            .appending(path: request.path)

        var urlRequest = URLRequest(url: url)
        urlRequest.httpMethod = request.method.name
        urlRequest.httpBody = request.body
        urlRequest.allHTTPHeaderFields = request.headers
        var components = URLComponents(url: url, resolvingAgainstBaseURL: false)
        components?.queryItems = request.queryParameter?.reduce(into: [URLQueryItem]()) { current, next in
            let item = URLQueryItem(name: next.key, value: next.value)
            current.append(item)
        }

        let (data, response) = try await session.data(for: urlRequest)

        guard let httpURLResponse = response as? HTTPURLResponse else {
            throw Error.noHttpURLResponse
        }

        guard let headers = httpURLResponse.allHeaderFields as? [String: String] else {
            throw Error.invalidHeaderArguments
        }

        let HttpResponse = HTTPResponse(statusCode: httpURLResponse.statusCode, headers: headers)
        return (data, HttpResponse)
    }
}
```

First, the `load(request:)` method constructs a `URLRequest` along with its query items based on the information provided in the `HTTPRequest`. It's important to note that `URLRequest` is considered an infrastructure detail as it's provided by Apple's `URLSession`. Second, the `session` is used to execute the request and wait for the reception of a response. Finally, the received response is interpreted as an `HTTPURLResponse` from which `headers` and `statusCode` are extracted.

By separating the feature from infrastructure details, we can integrate all components within the *composition root*. The latter serves as the translation layer between modules without requiring them to have knowledge of each other. This way, features can be developed in isolation by different feature teams which is essential for large-scale modulare applications.

![Architecture](article_18_02_2024_architecture.svg)

## Adding Functionality: Decorators

Especially within large-scale applications, we frequently encounter new or evolving business requirements, such as *logging* or *authentication*. Instead of modifying the infrastructure module, we can utilize the decorator pattern to add functionality without altering the underlying implementation. Consider the `AuthenticatedHTTPClient` as an illustration: it provides the same interface as the `HTTPClient`, yet it injects a Bearer token with every request. Through this approach, decorations are linked together until the desired behavior is achieved.

![Decorators](article_18_02_2024_decorators.svg)

Let's take a moment to highlight four decorations of the `HTTPClient` to deal with *authentication*, *error handling*, *header injection* as well as *logging*

### Authentication

First, let's start by taking a look at how we can add *authentication* to an existing `HTTPClient`. Given the client, as well as a closure that returns an access token the `AuthenticatedHTTPClient` injects the token as `Authentication` header into every request. Note that the closure providing the token is asynchronous and may return an error when the token retrival failed. In case, no token could be retrieved, the client throws the `missingAccessToken` error.

```swift
/// A `HTTPClient` decorator that extends requests to a client with an authentication token.
public class AuthenticatedHTTPClient: HTTPClient {
    enum Error: Swift.Error {
        /// Error if no AccessToken exists.
        case missingAccessToken
    }

    private let client: HTTPClient
    private let accessToken: () async throws -> String

    /// Decorates requests to a `HTTPClient` with the authentication token.
    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - client: The `HTTPClient` to be decorated.
    ///   - accessToken: A closure providing the AccessToken.
    public init(client: HTTPClient, accessToken: @escaping () async throws -> String) {
        self.client = client
        self.accessToken = accessToken
    }

    /// Executes the given network request.
    /// - Parameter request: The request to be executed.
    /// - Returns: The response including the data to the network request.
    public func load(request: HTTPRequest) async throws -> (Data, HTTPResponse) {
        var modifiedRequest = ModifiedRequest(request)
        var headers = modifiedRequest.headers ?? [:]

        do {
            headers["Authorization"] = try await accessToken()
        } catch {
            throw Error.missingAccessToken
        }

        modifiedRequest.headers = headers
        return try await client.load(request: modifiedRequest)
    }
}
```

The following extension allows to easily chain the `AuthenticatedHttpClient` with an existing client:

```swift
extension HTTPClient {
    /// Extends requests to a `HTTPClient` with the authentication token.
    /// - Returns: The `HTTPClient` extended with the authentication token.
    public func authenticated(accessToken: @escaping () async throws -> String) -> HTTPClient {
        AuthenticatedHTTPClient(client: self, accessToken: accessToken)
    }
}
```

Then, an existing client is augmented by calling `.authenticated` with a closure providing the acces token.

```swift
URLSessionClient(baseURL: baseURL, session: session)
    .authenticated(
        accessToken: {
            try await Task.sleep(nanoseconds: 1_000_000)
            return "Bearer <Token>"
        }
    )
```

### Error Handling

Similary to `authentication`, we can introduce a decorator that includes default error handling for responses with status codes outside of `200..<300`.

```swift
/// Error type encompassing errors that may occur during the execution of network requests.
public enum HTTPError: Error, Equatable {
    /// Error for responses to network requests containing a StatusCode not within `200..<300`.
    case httpCode(statusCode: HTTPStatusCode, data: Data)
}
```

The associated `ErrorHandlingHTTPClient` inspects the status code of the response and throws an `HTTPError.httpCode(statusCode:data:)` whenever it falls outside of the expected range.

```swift
/// A `HTTPClient` decorator implementing error handling for standard errors.
public class ErrorHandlingHTTPClient: HTTPClient {
    private let client: HTTPClient

    /// Decorates a HTTPClient with standard error handling.
    /// - Parameter client: The client to be decorated.
    public init(client: HTTPClient) {
        self.client = client
    }

    /// Executes the given network request.
    /// - Parameter request: The request to be executed.
    /// - Returns: The response including the data to the network request.
    public func load(request: HTTPRequest) async throws -> (Data, HTTPResponse) {
        let (data, response) = try await client.load(request: request)

        if !(200 ..< 300).contains(response.statusCode) {
            throw HTTPError.httpCode(statusCode: response.statusCode, data: data)
        } else {
            return (data, response)
        }
    }
}

extension HTTPClient {
    /// Decorates a `HTTPClient` with standard error handling.
    /// - Returns: The `HTTPClient` extended with standard error handling.
    public func handlingErrors() -> HTTPClient {
        ErrorHandlingHTTPClient(client: self)
    }
}
```

Using the extension, default error handling is added by calling `handlingErrors()` on an existing client.

```swift
URLSessionClient(baseURL: baseURL, session: session)
    .handlingErrors()
```

### Header Injection

Next, let's turn to the `HeadersInjectingHTTPClient` which injects arbitrary headers into a request.

```swift
/// A `HTTPClient` decorator that extends requests with additional HTTP headers.
public class HeadersInjectingHTTPClient: HTTPClient {
    private let client: HTTPClient
    private let headers: HTTPHeaders

    /// Decorates requests to a HTTPClient with additional headers.
    /// - Parameter client: The client to be decorated.
    /// - Parameter headers: The additional headers to be added to requests to the client.
    /// > Warning: Identically named headers that already exist will be overwritten.
    public init(client: HTTPClient, headers: HTTPHeaders) {
        self.client = client
        self.headers = headers
    }

    /// Executes the given network request.
    /// - Parameter request: The request to be executed.
    /// - Returns: The response including the data to the network request.
    public func load(request: HTTPRequest) async throws -> (Data, HTTPResponse) {
        var modifiedRequest = ModifiedRequest(request)
        var headers = modifiedRequest.headers ?? [:]
        self.headers.forEach { header in
            headers[header.key] = header.value
        }
        modifiedRequest.headers = headers
        return try await client.load(request: modifiedRequest)
    }
}

extension HTTPClient {
    /// Decorates requests to a `HTTPClient` with additional headers.
    /// - Returns: The `HTTPClient` extended with the additional headers.
    public func injecting(headers: HTTPHeaders) -> HTTPClient {
        HeadersInjectingHTTPClient(client: self, headers: headers)
    }
}
```

Using the extension we can add headers by calling `injecting(headers:)` on an existing client.

```swift
URLSessionClient(baseURL: baseURL, session: session)
    .injecting(
        headers: [
            "header1": "value1",
            "header2": "value2",
            "header3": "value3"
        ]
    )
```

### Logging Request and Responses

Finally, let's briefly discuss how we can handle logging using 

```swift
/// A `HTTPClient` decorator that logs requests.
public class LoggingHTTPClient: HTTPClient {
    private let client: HTTPClient

    /// Logs requests to a HTTPClient
    /// - Parameter client: The client to be decorated.
    public init(client: HTTPClient) {
        self.client = client
    }

    /// Executes the given network request.
    /// - Parameter request: The request to be executed.
    /// - Returns: The response including the data to the network request.
    public func load(request: HTTPRequest) async throws -> (Data, HTTPResponse) {
        print(describe(request: request))
        let (data, response) = try await client.load(request: request)
        print(describe(response: response, data: data))
        return (data, response)
    }
}

extension LoggingHTTPClient {
    private func describe(request: HTTPRequest) -> String {
        [
            "Outgoing Network Request ⬆️:",
            "-------------------------------",
            "Method: \(request.method.name)",
            "Path: \(request.path)",
            "Version: \(request.version)",
            request.headers.map { "Headers:\n\(describe(dict: $0))" },
            request.queryParameter.map { "Query-Parameter: \(String(describing: $0))" },
            request.body.map { "Body:\n\(describe(data: $0))" },
        ]
        .compactMap { $0 }
        .joined(separator: "\n")
    }

    private func describe(response: HTTPResponse, data: Data) -> String {
        [
            "Incoming Network Response ⬇️:",
            "------------------------------------------",
            "\(describe(response: response))",
            "Body:",
            "\(describe(data: data))",
        ]
        .joined(separator: "\n")
    }

    private func describe(response: HTTPResponse) -> String {
        [
            "StatusCode: \(response.statusCode)",
            response.headers.map { "Headers:\n\(describe(dict: $0))" },
        ]
        .compactMap { $0 }
        .joined(separator: "\n")
    }

    private func describe(data: Data) -> String {
        guard
            let object = try? JSONSerialization.jsonObject(with: data, options: []),
            let data = try? JSONSerialization.data(withJSONObject: object, options: [.prettyPrinted]),
            let value = NSString(data: data, encoding: String.Encoding.utf8.rawValue) 
        else {
            return String(data: data, encoding: .utf8) ?? ""
        }
        
        return String(value)
    }

    private func describe(dict: [String: String]) -> String {
        "\(dict.reduce("") { $0 + "    - \($1.key): \($1.value)\n" })"
    }
}

extension HTTPClient {
    /// Logs requests to a `HTTPClient`
    /// - Returns: The `HTTPClient` extended with request logging.
    public func loggingRequestAndResponse() -> HTTPClient {
        LoggingHTTPClient(client: self)
    }
}
```

```swift
URLSessionClient(baseURL: baseURL, session: session)
    .loggingRequestAndResponse()
```

```

### Infrastructure

## Usage Example: Token API

```swift
enum HTTPClientFactory {
    static func make(_ baseUrl: String) -> HTTPClient {
        let baseURL: URL = URL(string: baseUrl)!
        let configuration = URLSessionConfiguration.ephemeral
        configuration.timeoutIntervalForRequest = 30.0
        let session: URLSession = URLSession(configuration: configuration)
        return URLSessionClient(baseURL: baseURL, session: session)
    }
}
```

```swift
enum HTTPClientFactory {
    static func make(_ baseUrl: String) -> HTTPClient {
        let baseURL: URL = URL(string: baseUrl)!
        let configuration = URLSessionConfiguration.ephemeral
        configuration.timeoutIntervalForRequest = 30.0
        let session: URLSession = URLSession(configuration: configuration)
        return URLSessionClient(baseURL: baseURL, session: session)
            .loggingRequestAndResponse()
            .injecting(
                headers: [
                    "header1": "value1",
                    "header2": "value2",
                    "header3": "value3"
                ]
            )
            .authenticated(
                accessToken: {
                    try await Task.sleep(nanoseconds: 1_000_000)
                    return "Bearer <Token>"
                }
            )
    }
}
```

```swift
enum TokenAPI: HTTPRequest {
    case token
    case update(token: String)
    
    var method: HTTPMethod {
        switch self {
        case .token:
            return .get
        case .update:
            return .post
        }
    }
    
    var path: HTTPPath {
        return "token"
    }
    
    var version: HTTPVersion {
        return "v1"
    }
    
    var body: Data? {
        switch self {
        case let .update(token):
            return token.data(using: .utf8)
        default:
            return nil
        }
    }
}

```

```swift
enum TokenMapper {
    enum Error: Swift.Error {
        case invalidData
    }

    static func map(data: Data, response: HTTPResponse) throws -> String {
